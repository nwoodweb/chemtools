    "# Visualizing Molecules Within a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code has been created for the purpose of visualizing molecules within a Jupyter notebook. In essence, this notebook functions by reading xyz files, converting their contents into a SMILES code with the `ChemML` library, interpreting these SMILES codes as 2D molecular structures with the `RDKit` library, and visualizing the molecules in a grid. There are two main sections for visualization, based on the combinations of the main libraries implemented in each:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Section I - Visualization With RDKit\n",
    "- Section II - Visualization With RDKit and mols2grid\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of which section you'd like to access, there are some preliminary things that need to be set up, which are covered in the *Prerequisites* section.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, all of the required libraries for the notebook's functioning are imported, and all necessary variables are established with appropriate data. First, you'll do the former:"
