## Introduction


## Goals

### 3D Annotation of Molecules 
  We wish to examine alternatives to Visualizing Molecular Dynamics (VMD) to visualize isosurfaces of molecules computed by Chemtools. Examples of VMD Alternatives include Avogadro/Avogadro2, ChimeraX, IQMol, JMol/JSMol, and PyMOL. 

### 2D Annotation of Molecules

### Plotting of Vector and Scalar Qualities of Molecules 

### Visualizing Electrostatic Potential Isosurfaces 

### Molecular Graphs of Bond and Ring Critical Points 

## Results

## Post Mortem
### IOData Error in 2D Annotations 

### Discrepancies between VMD and ChimeraX 

### Molecular Graphs 
## Moving Forward
### Administrative

### Converting IOData Output into Chemical JSON 

### Molecular Graphs
