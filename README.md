## Introduction


## Goals

### Visualizing Electrostatic Potential Isosurfaces
  We wish to examine alternatives to Visualizing Molecular Dynamics (VMD) to visualize isosurfaces of molecules computed by Chemtools. Examples of VMD Alternatives include Avogadro/Avogadro2, ChimeraX, IQMol, JMol/JSMol, and PyMOL. 

### 3D Annotation of Molecules
  We wish to devise a means of taking IOData output, such as electrostatic potential charges, and applying these values as text annotations in a molecule rendered in a three dimensional environment.                        

### 2D Annotation of Molecules
  We wish to implement a means of not only visualizing a given molecule originating from a Gaussian Checkpoint file (fchk), but also annotating a 2-dimensional representation of this molecule using data from IOData.

### Plotting of Vector and Scalar Qualities of Molecules 
  We wish to develop a means of visualizing the computation of both scalar and vector qualities of molecules.

### Molecular Graphs of Bond and Ring Critical Points 
  We wish to implement a means of visualizing the bond and ring critical points of a given molecule.

## Results
